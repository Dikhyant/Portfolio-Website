        title : "How I got my first job opportunity at a game development studio",
        content : `It all starts back in October 2020 . I was scrolling through my instagram feed and came across an advertisement of someone named Shashank Udhapa. The ad was about financial literacy. Now you may be wondering how does Shashank Udhapa or ad about financial literacy has to do anything with game dev. Well that’s where things started to change in my life. That’s where the fun began.

        Being curious about Shashank Udhapa , I started to search about him on the internet. First his Instagram profile then Google . While doing this I came across something called Avalon and someone named Varun Mayya. Yep there was a time when I didn’t know Varun Mayya. While doing research on Varun Mayya I came across one of his advertisements about Avalon Meta Game Dev Pro League. Game Dev Pro league is basically an one year community based work shop . In this work shop participants will be divided into teams and they will work together to make videogames and vfx films . The price of the Pro league was quite expensive and I had this doubt that whether it’ll be worth it. After critically thinking about how stagnant my life really was and things needed to change , I took a leap of faith and signed up for the Avalon Meta Game Dev Pro League.
        
        You probably are more interested in the part where how I landed the job opportunity . So I am not gonna talk too much about my one year workshop journey with Varun Mayya and his fellow Avalonians . I’ll just summarize it. After having an ice breaker session at the beginning of the workshop I did manage to find myself a bunch of people to tag along and make a team. 
        We were a bit sloppy at the beginning but did manage to finish a vfx film and showcase it to our other pals at the Pro League. Made a couple of games on our own. Some of us got a chance to be featured in a podcast with Varun Mayya where each one of us showcased our videogames that we had made within this journey with Avalon. 
        Mr. Varun required us to submit our CVs so that he and team can reach out to game dev studios and get us job opportunities . 
        
        One company reached my out. They are  “Bombay Play” . A Bengaluru based Game Development Startup that is experienced in developing 2D mobile card games and they have raised investment of more than two million dollars from Venture Capitals like Leo Capital and Lumikai. First I had a telephonic interview of about fifteen minutes with Bombay Play’s HR. She asked to tell her something about my self , my experience with game engines and programming languages data structures and algorithms and stuff about my college. She debriefed me about the selection process. Basically there will be four technical rounds. One pre screening round and three tech rounds. After the call ended she fixed the pre screening round on next week to the day the call had taken place.
        
        The Pre Screening round was of thirty minutes. My interviewer was a front end developer at Bombay Play. First he told me to tell me something about my self. I started the introduction by telling him about how my journey in game dev began. Me starting to make games in Python then moving on to Godot an open source game engine and then finishing two games in Unity and currently working in Unreal Engine. After this intro he explained me the process of the tech round that he will simply give me some problems and I am suppose to find a solution and write sudo code for these solutions.
        
        The first question was about MS Excel. Excel has English alphabet strings to index the columns. The columns go something like this A B C D .. Z AA AB AC .. AZ BA BB .. ZZ AAA .. ZZZ and so one. If the user gives a column name as input then the output should be the position of that column in interger. For example , if the input is A then output should be 1 , if input is AA then ouput should be 27 and if input is ZA then output should be 677 and so on.
